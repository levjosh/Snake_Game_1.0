# Snake Game
## How to Play
UP Arrow - Move Up
DOWN Arrow - Move Down
LEFT Arrow - Move Left
RIGHT Arrow - Move Right

## Background
Simple project to help practice my Python skills. I'm sure this version of the game may not come out the way I'd like it but I hope to get it as good as I can with this iteration. Perhaps in the future, I will come out with cleaner/optimized code for Snake Game 2.0 in the future.

## Current Bugs
- None

## Features to Add
- Game Over Screen
- Smoother movement
- Images to represent the body of the snake rather than just drawing rectangles
